# YOLOv7-DeepSORT

The main objectives were to analyze the impact of the optimization algorithm on the model results.

## Methodology
- Utilized the same dataset (from Robotflow) as before.
- Trained the models using time frames ranging from 5 PM to 8 PM.
- Created three versions of the model: small, medium, and large.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as F1 curve, P curve, mAP (mean average precision), accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Evaluation
- Ensured a fair comparison by using the same dataset for each model and evaluating their performance separately.
- Created confusion matrices for each model to compare accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Visualized the training progress of each model using time series graphs.
