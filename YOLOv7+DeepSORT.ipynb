    "In this activity, we will be updating our previous object detection model to YOLOv7 and integrating it with DeepSORT for optimization. The goal is to analyze the impact of the optimization algorithm on the model results and compare the performance of the updated models with the previous ones. We will be using the same dataset as before, but this time we will train the models using time frames ranging from 5 PM to 8 PM. We will be creating three versions of the model - **_small, medium, and large_ - and evaluating their performance using metrics such as F1 curve, P curve, mAP (mean average precision), accuracy, precision, and recall.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a fair comparison, we will use the same dataset for each model and evaluate their performance separately. We will create a confusion matrix for each model and compare their accuracy, precision, and recall. We will also visualize the training progress of each model using time series graphs."
